👋 Hi, I’m Madhusudan Ray

🚀 Odoo Backend Developer | Python Enthusiast | Full-Stack Learner

I am a backend-focused developer with hands-on experience in Odoo 19, Python, and ORM-based application development. I actively build real-world modules (Library Management System, Automobile Module, Accounting workflows) and continuously upskill toward full-stack development using MERN.

I believe in learning by building, understanding systems deeply, and writing maintainable, scalable code.
